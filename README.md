📌 Concealed Pistol Classification using VGG16
🚀 A deep learning model using VGG16 to classify concealed pistols.

📷 Dataset
The dataset contains images of concealed and non-concealed pistols.
Images are preprocessed and augmented before training.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow, Keras
OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
📊 Model Architecture
Uses VGG16 pretrained on ImageNet
Fine-tuned for firearm concealment classification
Optimized using Adam and categorical cross-entropy
